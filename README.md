# IAmMyGuy21st
## Hello?
### Info:
This is basically my entire Github Pages website. I mostly add some code tests, but sometimes I add things for my own personal use. Things like:
- Tests
- Other websites
- Things I just type out for fun
- etc.
### I know the name of this repository and the name of my account are spelled wrong, but I'm too lazy to change that. Also the favicon is from fluent emoji.
